## 1. Information We Collect

We do not collect any personal information (such as your name, email address, or phone number) directly. All calculations (SIP, EMI, Retirement, etc.) are performed locally on your device.

### Local Storage

We use local storage on your device (`SharedPreferences`) to save your last used calculator inputs (e.g., investment amounts, interest rates) to improve your user experience. This data never leaves your device and is not shared with us or any third parties.

### Automatic Data Collection (AdMob)

We use **Google AdMob** to display advertisements in our app. AdMob may collect and use certain data to serve personalized ads, including:

* **Device ID & Advertising ID:** To identify your device for advertising purposes.
* **Usage Data:** Information about how you interact with the ads and the application.
* **Diagnostics:** Crash logs and performance data to ensure the stability of the ad SDK.

## 2. Third-Party Services

We may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:

* To facilitate our Service (e.g., Google Play Services);
* To provide the Service on our behalf;
* To perform Service-related services; or
* To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.

We want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

## 4. Security

We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers.
